      question: "What services do you offer?",
      answer: "I provide comprehensive physical therapy services including injury assessment and treatment, performance optimization coaching, and specialized programs for outdoor athletes. Services are available both virtually and in-person in Utah."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you accept insurance?",
      answer: "Currently, I operate as a private practice and do not accept insurance. This allows me to provide personalized, high-quality care without insurance restrictions. Payment plans and package deals are available."
    },
    {
      question: "How long are sessions?",
      answer: "Initial assessments are typically 60 minutes, while follow-up sessions are 45 minutes. Specialized programs may include longer initial sessions for comprehensive evaluation and planning."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you work with athletes?",
      answer: "Absolutely! I specialize in working with outdoor athletes, runners, cyclists, climbers, and anyone pursuing active lifestyles. My approach combines clinical expertise with real-world performance optimization."
    },
    {
      question: "What should I bring to my first appointment?",
      answer: "Please bring any relevant medical records, imaging results, or previous therapy notes. Wear comfortable clothing suitable for light movement assessment. If you have specific goals or concerns, write them down to discuss during our session."
    },
    {
      question: "How do virtual sessions work?",
      answer: "Virtual sessions use secure video conferencing. You'll need a computer or tablet with a camera, and a quiet space where you can move freely. I'll guide you through assessments and exercises in real-time."
    },
    {
      question: "What conditions do you treat?",
      answer: "I treat a wide range of musculoskeletal conditions including sports injuries, chronic pain, post-surgical rehabilitation, movement dysfunctions, and performance limitations. I also focus on injury prevention and movement optimization."
    },
    {
      question: "How many sessions will I need?",
      answer: "This varies depending on your specific condition and goals. Some acute injuries may resolve in 4-6 sessions, while chronic conditions or performance optimization programs may require longer-term care. We'll discuss a personalized plan during your initial assessment."
